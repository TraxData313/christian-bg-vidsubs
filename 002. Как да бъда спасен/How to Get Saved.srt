1
00:00:00,199 --> 00:00:02,879
Добре дошли. Казвам се Робър Брейкър и

2
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:04,830
днес искам да ви обясня

3
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:07,649
как да бъдете спасени, какво Библията казва относно

4
00:00:07,649 --> 00:00:11,250
"КАК ДА БЪДЕМ СПАСЕНИ". В Евреи 9:27 в Библията пише

5
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:16,550
"И тъй като е определено на човеците веднъж да умрат, а след това настава съд"

7
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:19,770
Всеки човек ще умре един ден. Библията

8
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:22,230
ни казва, че всеки трябва да умре, но

9
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:24,210
къде ще отидеш ти като умреш?

10
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:26,240
Ще прекараш вечността в рая или в ада?

11
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:28,370
Димящ или недимящ?

12
00:00:28,370 --> 00:00:30,229
Някога мислил ли си за това? 

13
00:00:30,229 --> 00:00:33,199
Библията ни казва как да отидем в рая. 

14
00:00:33,199 --> 00:00:36,090
Казва, че трябва да бъдем спасени от ада. 

15
00:00:36,090--> 00:00:43,190
Така, че да бъдеш спасен, означава, че си спасен от ада и ще отидеш в рая когато умреш.

17
00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:48,480
В 1 Тимотей 2:4, Библията говори за Бог или Исус Христос:

19
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:53,160
"Който иска да се спасят всичките човеци и да достигнат до познание на истината."


21
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:58,949
"Познание на истината" означава, че има нещо, което трябва да знаеш, да чуеш, за да разбереш "КАК ДА БЪДЕШ СПАСЕН".

24
00:00:58,949 --> 00:01:04,559
Така че, това което искам да направя днес е да ти дам знанието за истината и "КАК ДА БЪДЕШ СПАСЕН"

27
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:13,379
В Йоан 3:15 пише "че всеки, който вярва в Него няма да погине, но ще има вечен живот."

30
00:01:13,379 --> 00:01:16,180
Бог иска да ти даде вечен живот.

31
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:21,009
Искаш ли да разбереш как да имаш вечен живот в рая?

33
00:01:21,009 --> 00:01:32,400
В Деяния 13:38 пише: "Нека ви бъде известно, следователно, хора и братя, че чрез Него (Христос) се проповядва на вас прощение на греховете."

37
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,920
Бог предлага опрощение на всичките ти грехове

38
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:37,650
и вечен живот, но не чрез нашите дела,

39
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:42,509
а чрез Словото на Бог, което ни довежда до Исус Христос

41
00:01:42,509 --> 00:01:45,000
и до това какво Той е направил за теб.

42
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:51,599
Нека първо разгледаме някои стихове в Библията относно "как да бъдем спасени".

45
00:01:51,599 --> 00:01:53,820
Първо трябва да разбереш, че си грешник.

46
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:58,039
Някои хора си мислят, че са добри и че заслужават рая.

48
00:01:58,039 --> 00:02:02,349
Те мислят "Толкова съм добър, че Бог трябва да ми отвори перлените врати, за да ме пусне".

49
00:02:02,349 --> 00:02:03,840
Но какво казва Библията?

50
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:08,550
Казва ли Библията, че има добри хора? Хиляда пъти "НЕ!"

52
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:15,600
В Римляни 3:10 четем: "Както е писано: Няма праведни, не, ни един"

56
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:19,110
Това означава, че никой не е достатъчно добър да иде в рая.

57
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:25,770
Римляни 3:23 казва "Защото всички съгрешиха и не достигат до Божията слава"

59
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:29,040
Тъй че, без значение колко добър мислиш че си,

60
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:35,510
Бог те вижда какъвто всъщност си, Бог те вижда като грешник.

62
00:02:35,510 --> 00:02:39,390
Защо умират хората? Заради греха.

63
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:41,430
Ако не беше грешник щеше да живееш вечно, но

64
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:43,920
всеки умира и, както започнахме,

65
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:47,470
"И тъй като е определено на човеците веднъж да умрат, а след това настава съд"
says it appointed unto man once to die

67
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:52,430
Когато умреш ще застанеш пред Бог да дадеш обяснение за себе си на Бог.

68
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:58,230
Римляни 5:12 пише "Затова, както чрез един човек грехът влезе в света,

71
00:02:58,230 --> 00:03:04,110
и смъртта чрез греха, и така смъртта мина във ВСИЧКИТЕ човеци, понеже ВСИЧКИ съгрешиха"

73
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:10,530
Всички мъже съгрешиха, всички жени съгрешиха, когато Библията казва "всички човеци", има впредвид

75
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:12,989
всички които някога са се раждали са грешници.

76
00:03:12,989 --> 00:03:18,570
Заради това умират. Така че спасението не е нещо, което може да заработим.

78
00:03:18,570 --> 00:03:23,530
А е дар от Бог. Как да приемеш този дар?

80
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:27,540
Библията ни учи - ЧРЕЗ ВЯРА. Чрез вяра сме спасени.

81
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:38,820
В Ефесяни 2:8-9 пише: "Защото по благодат сте спасени чрез вяра, и то не от сами вас, а е дарът от Бог, не чрез дела, да не би някой човек да се хвали"

85
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:43,019
Спасението не е чрез това, което ние правим. Не можем да заслужим пътя си към рая,

87
00:03:43,019 --> 00:03:48,760
защото не сме добри, "Няма праведни, не, ни един"

89
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:51,400
Това е дар, който Бог ни предлага. И какво представлява този дар?

90
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:56,850
В Римляни 6:23 пише: "Заплатата за греха е смърт, но дарът на Бог е вечен живот"

92
00:03:56,850 --> 00:03:59,640
through Jesus Christ our Lord

93
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:01,920
so salvation is not of works but rather

94
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:05,489
receiving eternal life by faith faith is

95
00:04:05,489 --> 00:04:08,790
how God chose to save us today not by

96
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:11,970
works Galatians 2:16 says knowing that a

97
00:04:11,970 --> 00:04:14,640
man is not justified by the works of the

98
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,620
law but by the faith of Jesus Christ

99
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:19,290
even we have believed in Jesus Christ

100
00:04:19,290 --> 00:04:21,089
that we might be justified by the faith

101
00:04:21,089 --> 00:04:23,760
of Christ not by the works of the law

102
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:25,440
unless

103
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:26,790
by the works of the law shall no flesh

104
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:30,360
be justified you can't get to heaven by

105
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:33,720
your works God won't allow a sinner to

106
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:35,280
come in to the pearly gates

107
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,560
so God offers a free gift of eternal

108
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:40,560
life but that free gift is only through

109
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:43,650
faith not of works romans 4:5 says but

110
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:45,750
to him that worketh not but believeth on

111
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:47,370
him that justifieth the ungodly his

112
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:51,960
faith is counted for righteousness but

113
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:54,810
the question is faith in what the answer

114
00:04:54,810 --> 00:04:57,750
is faith in the gospel the gospel is

115
00:04:57,750 --> 00:04:59,340
found in first Corinthians chapter 15

116
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:02,820
and verses 1 through 4 and the gospel is

117
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:05,850
that Jesus Christ died for our sins I'll

118
00:05:05,850 --> 00:05:06,840
read that to you

119
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:08,580
let me go ahead and write it up here the

120
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:11,040
gospel I hope you have a Bible and I

121
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,510
hope if you do you go through these

122
00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:15,300
verses with me and look them up see what

123
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:18,870
the Bible says about salvation because

124
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:20,550
this is the most important thing in the

125
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:21,570
entire world

126
00:05:21,570 --> 00:05:23,970
you're never dying so where you will

127
00:05:23,970 --> 00:05:27,600
spend eternity for all eternity where

128
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,210
will your soul be for all eternity the

129
00:05:30,210 --> 00:05:32,070
gospel is in 1st Corinthians chapter 15

130
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:35,130
verses 1 through 4 and as we read first

131
00:05:35,130 --> 00:05:37,320
Corinthians one through four we we see

132
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:40,080
what it is that God did for us it's not

133
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:42,930
what we do that saves us it's all what

134
00:05:42,930 --> 00:05:47,400
Jesus Christ did for us we read in 1st

135
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:49,560
Corinthians 15 1 through 4 moreover

136
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:51,960
moreover brethren I declare unto you the

137
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:54,030
gospel which I preached unto you which

138
00:05:54,030 --> 00:05:55,950
also you received and wherein you stand

139
00:05:55,950 --> 00:05:58,500
by which also ye are saved if you keep

140
00:05:58,500 --> 00:05:59,910
in memory what I've preached unto you

141
00:05:59,910 --> 00:06:02,100
unless you believed in vain for I

142
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:03,720
delivered unto you first of all that

143
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:05,580
which I also received how that Christ

144
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:08,280
died for our sins according to the

145
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:10,530
scriptures and that he was buried and

146
00:06:10,530 --> 00:06:12,090
that he rose again the third day

147
00:06:12,090 --> 00:06:15,090
according to the scriptures so the

148
00:06:15,090 --> 00:06:19,620
gospel is that Jesus Christ died he died

149
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:21,540
on the cross shedding his blood on the

150
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:24,030
cross of Calvary the gospel is that he

151
00:06:24,030 --> 00:06:26,400
died was buried and rose again the third

152
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,770
day according to the scriptures but I

153
00:06:28,770 --> 00:06:31,230
left out a few words the most important

154
00:06:31,230 --> 00:06:35,940
words it says for our sins why did Jesus

155
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:38,050
Christ died he died for our

156
00:06:38,050 --> 00:06:41,680
sins Jesus Christ died in our place for

157
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:45,490
our sins he paid for your sins so you

158
00:06:45,490 --> 00:06:47,440
don't have to go to hell and pay for

159
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:48,970
them for all eternity

160
00:06:48,970 --> 00:06:51,520
so the gospel is what Jesus Christ did

161
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:55,060
for you Jesus Christ died in your place

162
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:57,629
for your sins on the cross of Calvary

163
00:06:57,629 --> 00:07:00,340
paying for your sins that so that you

164
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:02,530
don't have to go to hell and pay for

165
00:07:02,530 --> 00:07:03,639
them yourself

166
00:07:03,639 --> 00:07:07,990
he is the sacrifice for all sinners and

167
00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:10,180
his sacrifice is clearly seen when you

168
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:13,659
died on the cross the old saying is

169
00:07:13,659 --> 00:07:16,419
Jesus Christ loved me this much as he

170
00:07:16,419 --> 00:07:19,629
spread his arms and died in first John

171
00:07:19,629 --> 00:07:22,000
4:10 we read about the love of Jesus and

172
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,400
his sacrifice first John 4:10 says here

173
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:27,460
in his love not that we loved God but

174
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:29,800
that he loved us and sent his son to be

175
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:32,800
the propitiation for our sins a

176
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:35,740
propitiation is like a substitute he

177
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:38,650
died in my place he paid for my sins

178
00:07:38,650 --> 00:07:41,319
first John 2:2 says and not for ours

179
00:07:41,319 --> 00:07:43,419
only but also for the sins of the whole

180
00:07:43,419 --> 00:07:46,900
world who did Jesus Christ die for the

181
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:48,099
entire world

182
00:07:48,099 --> 00:07:51,159
he paid for the sins of the entire world

183
00:07:51,159 --> 00:07:54,430
1st Peter 3:18 we read for Christ also

184
00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:58,779
hath once suffered for sins the just for

185
00:07:58,779 --> 00:08:00,729
the unjust that he might bring us to God

186
00:08:00,729 --> 00:08:02,620
being put to death in the flesh but

187
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:05,529
quickened by the spirit so Jesus Christ

188
00:08:05,529 --> 00:08:10,090
died once and that one death was for our

189
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:11,080
sins

190
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:13,539
not just my sins and your sins but the

191
00:08:13,539 --> 00:08:14,979
sins of the entire world

192
00:08:14,979 --> 00:08:19,000
Jesus Christ died for everyone what for

193
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,889
the verse says that he might bring us to

194
00:08:20,889 --> 00:08:23,560
God the way to heaven is through the

195
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:25,419
death burial and resurrection of Jesus

196
00:08:25,419 --> 00:08:25,960
Christ

197
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:28,629
because Jesus did that for our sins and

198
00:08:28,629 --> 00:08:31,240
if you come and accept the gospel and

199
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:33,640
trust the gospel it's to bring us to God

200
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:35,769
it takes us to heaven that's how we get

201
00:08:35,769 --> 00:08:36,399
saved

202
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:39,578
so Jesus Christ is the one who saves and

203
00:08:39,578 --> 00:08:41,979
salvation is by Jesus dying for your

204
00:08:41,979 --> 00:08:45,339
sins but not only did he die how did he

205
00:08:45,339 --> 00:08:45,850
die

206
00:08:45,850 --> 00:08:46,870
he'd shed

207
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:49,120
blood for you it's through the blood

208
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:51,970
that Jesus Christ shed that paid for our

209
00:08:51,970 --> 00:08:54,700
sins in Hebrews chapter 19 verse 22 the

210
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:56,500
Bible says and almost all things are by

211
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:58,660
the law purged with blood and without

212
00:08:58,660 --> 00:09:02,560
shedding of blood is no remission of the

213
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:06,730
sins God demands blood for sins the Old

214
00:09:06,730 --> 00:09:08,730
Testament God told them to sacrifice

215
00:09:08,730 --> 00:09:13,570
animals and in the Old Testament those

216
00:09:13,570 --> 00:09:15,250
animals were sacrificed and that

217
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:17,520
sacrifice of animals is what gave them

218
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:20,410
forgiveness of sins well now we have the

219
00:09:20,410 --> 00:09:22,360
New Testament and in the New Testament

220
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:25,080
it's Jesus Christ who is our sacrifice

221
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:27,790
today we don't go and sacrifice the lamb

222
00:09:27,790 --> 00:09:30,610
or an animal Jesus was the sacrifice in

223
00:09:30,610 --> 00:09:32,410
fact when Jesus came John the Baptist

224
00:09:32,410 --> 00:09:35,230
said behold the lamb of God which taketh

225
00:09:35,230 --> 00:09:38,470
away the sin of the world that's why in

226
00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:40,150
Hebrews chapter 9 and verse 12 we read

227
00:09:40,150 --> 00:09:42,130
neither by the blood of goats and calves

228
00:09:42,130 --> 00:09:45,190
but by his own blood he entered in once

229
00:09:45,190 --> 00:09:47,170
into the holy place having obtained

230
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:51,459
eternal redemption for us Jesus died to

231
00:09:51,459 --> 00:09:55,839
redeem mankind first Peter 1:18 says for

232
00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:57,010
as much as you know that you were not

233
00:09:57,010 --> 00:09:58,750
redeemed with corruptible things as

234
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:00,100
silver and gold from your vain

235
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:02,860
conversation received by tradition from

236
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:04,959
your father's but with the precious

237
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:07,000
blood of Christ as of a lamb without

238
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,360
blemish and without spot Jesus Christ

239
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:13,630
the Lamb of God died in my place for my

240
00:10:13,630 --> 00:10:17,260
sins and your sins and now in the New

241
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:18,490
Testament when we build in the New

242
00:10:18,490 --> 00:10:20,680
Testament it talks about Jesus Christ it

243
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:22,660
tells us that forgiveness is not from

244
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:24,760
the animals that they sacrificed under

245
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:27,130
the law salvation is not through the

246
00:10:27,130 --> 00:10:30,970
blood of a goat or a lamb salvation is

247
00:10:30,970 --> 00:10:34,089
through the blood shed by Jesus Christ

248
00:10:34,089 --> 00:10:37,839
that's why Colossians 1:14 says and whom

249
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:40,720
we have redemption through his Jesus's

250
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:44,620
blood even the forgiveness of sins first

251
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:46,839
John 1:7 says in the blood of Jesus

252
00:10:46,839 --> 00:10:50,790
Christ His Son cleanseth us from all sin

253
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:52,810
salvation is by the blood of Jesus

254
00:10:52,810 --> 00:10:53,290
Christ

255
00:10:53,290 --> 00:10:56,410
He shed his precious blood for you and

256
00:10:56,410 --> 00:11:00,279
the question is what have you done with

257
00:11:00,279 --> 00:11:03,100
Jesus Christ to be saved you must trust

258
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:06,220
that blood that Jesus said shed for you

259
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:08,889
Romans chapter 3 verses 23 through 28

260
00:11:08,889 --> 00:11:11,529
are some powerful scriptures about

261
00:11:11,529 --> 00:11:14,649
salvation in these passages of Romans

262
00:11:14,649 --> 00:11:17,649
3:24 through 28 we read being justified

263
00:11:17,649 --> 00:11:20,410
freely by His grace through the

264
00:11:20,410 --> 00:11:22,089
redemption that is in Christ Jesus

265
00:11:22,089 --> 00:11:25,329
salvation is by grace not by works by

266
00:11:25,329 --> 00:11:28,329
believing Romans 3:25 whom God had set

267
00:11:28,329 --> 00:11:30,279
forth to be a propitiation through faith

268
00:11:30,279 --> 00:11:32,949
in his blood to declare his

269
00:11:32,949 --> 00:11:35,139
righteousness for the remission of sins

270
00:11:35,139 --> 00:11:36,879
that are past through the forbearance of

271
00:11:36,879 --> 00:11:39,399
God to declare I say at this time his

272
00:11:39,399 --> 00:11:42,129
righteousness that he might be just and

273
00:11:42,129 --> 00:11:44,649
the justifier of him which believeth in

274
00:11:44,649 --> 00:11:45,279
Jesus

275
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:48,399
where's boasting then is it is excluded

276
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:49,779
but what law works

277
00:11:49,779 --> 00:11:52,600
named by the law of faith therefore we

278
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:54,999
conclude that a man is justified by

279
00:11:54,999 --> 00:11:58,629
faith without the deeds of the law Jesus

280
00:11:58,629 --> 00:12:01,180
Christ is the righteous who never sinned

281
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:05,170
the sinless one the just died for us the

282
00:12:05,170 --> 00:12:08,649
unjust of the sinners and by so doing he

283
00:12:08,649 --> 00:12:11,829
proved that he was God who died at shed

284
00:12:11,829 --> 00:12:14,410
his blood and by rising again he proved

285
00:12:14,410 --> 00:12:16,899
that he was gone Jesus Christ was God

286
00:12:16,899 --> 00:12:19,300
manifest in the flesh that means Jesus

287
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:21,670
is God and that God loved us enough that

288
00:12:21,670 --> 00:12:24,879
he died for our sins and then it says

289
00:12:24,879 --> 00:12:27,490
where is boasting then it is excluded we

290
00:12:27,490 --> 00:12:30,189
can't boast and say how good we are will

291
00:12:30,189 --> 00:12:33,670
never compare to how good god is and how

292
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:36,250
good Jesus is so we can't boast in

293
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:39,610
ourselves and our works we have to boast

294
00:12:39,610 --> 00:12:41,889
in Jesus Christ and his finished work

295
00:12:41,889 --> 00:12:45,300
what he did when he died for our sins

296
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:47,559
when you come to Jesus and believe what

297
00:12:47,559 --> 00:12:49,269
he's done for you and trust in the blood

298
00:12:49,269 --> 00:12:51,490
you are saved and on your way to heaven

299
00:12:51,490 --> 00:12:54,610
you have forgiveness of sins the Bible

300
00:12:54,610 --> 00:12:57,189
says Ephesians 1:13 says in whom ye also

301
00:12:57,189 --> 00:12:59,589
trusted after that ye heard the word of

302
00:12:59,589 --> 00:13:03,160
truth the gospel of your salvation in

303
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:05,230
him also after that she believed you

304
00:13:05,230 --> 00:13:07,929
were sealed with that holy spirit of

305
00:13:07,929 --> 00:13:10,269
promise that means when you are saved

306
00:13:10,269 --> 00:13:13,089
you receive the Holy Spirit you are

307
00:13:13,089 --> 00:13:16,569
again salvation is so simple it's simply

308
00:13:16,569 --> 00:13:18,790
trusting and believing what Jesus did

309
00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:21,459
for you because he did all this for our

310
00:13:21,459 --> 00:13:25,600
sins in your place for you first John

311
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,999
5:13 says that you can know that you're

312
00:13:27,999 --> 00:13:30,100
saved it says these things have I

313
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:31,389
written unto you that believe on the

314
00:13:31,389 --> 00:13:33,279
name of the Son of God that you may know

315
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:35,199
that you have eternal life and that you

316
00:13:35,199 --> 00:13:37,149

00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:40,180
God do you know that you're saved you

Jesus as your Savior or you can take the
